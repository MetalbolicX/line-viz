# LineViz Component Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The `LineViz` web component has been refactored to integrate with the new modular architecture, incorporating the service layer and event-driven communication patterns.

## Key Architectural Improvements

### 1. Event-Driven Communication

- **ChartEventEmitter Integration**: Added a `ChartEventEmitter` instance to enable decoupled communication
- **Event Broadcasting**: The component now emits events for:
  - `data-changed`: When chart data is updated
  - `series-changed`: When series selection changes
  - `zoom-changed`: When zoom state changes
  - `config-changed`: When configuration is updated
  - `render-complete`: When chart rendering finishes
  - `interaction-start/end`: When user interactions begin/end

### 2. Service Layer Integration

- **ConfigurationManager**: Centralized configuration management with validation
  - Attributes are parsed using `ConfigurationManager.createFromAttributes()`
  - Default configurations are merged with user-provided values
  - Configuration validation ensures data integrity
- **DataService**: Delegated data filtering and validation logic
  - Series filtering moved to `DataService.selectedSeries()`
  - Data validation using `DataService.validateDataSet()`
  - Future-ready for complex data transformations

### 3. State Management Improvements

- **Centralized Configuration**: Replaced individual property declarations with a single `ChartConfig` object
- **Event-Driven Updates**: UI controls update in response to events rather than direct state mutations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Render timing is tracked and emitted via events

### 4. Separation of Concerns

- **DOM Event Handling**: Separated DOM event listeners from chart event management
- **Configuration Logic**: Moved from imperative switch statements to declarative service calls
- **UI Updates**: Extracted control updates into dedicated methods

## API Enhancements

### Public Event Methods

```typescript
// Subscribe to chart events
chart.on('data-changed', (event) => {
  console.log('Data updated:', event.detail);
});

// One-time event subscription
chart.once('render-complete', (event) => {
  console.log('Initial render took:', event.detail.renderTime, 'ms');
});

// Unsubscribe from events
chart.off('series-changed', handler);
```

### Configuration Management

- Attributes are automatically parsed and validated
- Configuration changes trigger events for external consumers
- Default values are consistently applied

## Benefits

### 1. **Improved Maintainability**

- Clear separation between data, configuration, and presentation logic
- Service layer centralizes business logic
- Event-driven architecture reduces coupling

### 2. **Better Testability**

- Services can be tested independently
- Event emissions can be verified in tests
- Configuration validation is isolated and testable

### 3. **Enhanced Extensibility**

- External consumers can listen to chart events
- New features can be added through the service layer
- Configuration system supports easy extension

### 4. **Performance Monitoring**

- Render times are tracked and exposed
- Event-driven updates reduce unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized data filtering through services

## Migration Impact

### Backward Compatibility

- All existing public APIs remain unchanged
- Web component attributes work exactly as before
- No breaking changes to consumer code

### Internal Changes

- Configuration properties moved from individual fields to centralized object
- Data filtering logic moved to service layer
- Event system added for internal and external communication

## Future Enhancements Enabled

1. **Analytics Integration**: Event system enables easy integration with analytics platforms
2. **Performance Optimization**: Service layer provides hooks for caching and optimization
3. **Plugin Architecture**: Event-driven design supports plugin development
4. **Testing Framework**: Isolated services and events enable comprehensive testing
5. **External State Management**: Events can integrate with state management libraries

## Code Quality Improvements

- **Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript integration with service layer
- **Error Handling**: Centralized validation and error reporting
- **Documentation**: Enhanced JSDoc comments with usage examples
- **Consistency**: Standardized patterns across the component

This refactoring establishes a solid foundation for future feature development while maintaining all existing functionality and improving the overall architecture of the line visualization component.
