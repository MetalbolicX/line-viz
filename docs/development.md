# Development Documentation

This section provides insights into the development practices, architecture, and design decisions made during the creation of the `LineViz` web component. It is intended for developers who want to understand the internal workings of the component or contribute to its development.

## Architecture Overview

The `LineViz` web component is built using TypeScript and follows a modular architecture. The core components include:

- **Rendering**: Utilizes D3.js to render all elements of the line chart and handle chart interactivity.
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and classes for common tasks, such as data formatting and event handling.
- **Services**: Abstractions for managing configurations and data processing, as well as SVG dimensions according to D3.js conventions.
- **Event Management**: Implements an event-driven architecture to facilitate communication between different parts of the component.
- **Types**: TypeScript interfaces and types to ensure type safety and improve code maintainability.

## Development Decisions

### d3-line-viz.ts

The `d3-line-viz.ts` module is a a factory function `createLineVizChart` thet uses the builder pattern to allow method chaining for configuration. It initializes a context object (`ChartContext`) that holds all the necessary state and configuration for rendering a D3.js line chart.

The `ChartContext` object is passed to each rendering function to seperate state and logic.in separate modules.

The `d3-line-viz.ts` needs to initialize the context object with default values and provide methods to update the configuration. So in the `services/` folder, there are modules like `ConfigurationManager`, `DataService`, and `ChartDimensions` that encapsulate specific logic related to configuration management, data processing, and SVG dimension handling.
