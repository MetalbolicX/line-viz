# Development Documentation

This section provides insights into the development practices, architecture, and design decisions made during the creation of the `LineViz` web component. It is intended for developers who want to understand the internal workings of the component or contribute to its development.

## Architecture Overview

The `LineViz` web component is built using TypeScript and follows a modular architecture. The core components include:

- **Rendering**: Utilizes D3.js to render all elements of the line chart and handle chart interactivity.
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and classes for common tasks, such as data formatting and event handling.
- **Services**: Abstractions for managing configurations and data processing, as well as SVG dimensions according to D3.js conventions.
- **Event Management**: Implements an event-driven architecture to facilitate communication between different parts of the component.
- **Types**: TypeScript interfaces and types to ensure type safety and improve code maintainability.
